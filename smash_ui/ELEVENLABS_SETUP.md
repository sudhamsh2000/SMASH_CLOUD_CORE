```

### Option B: Professional Voice Models

For the most accurate results, you can use specialized voice models designed to replicate the Jarvis tone and cadence.

- **Speaker Boost**: Enabled for enhanced clarity

## üéØ Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to browser TTS if ElevenLabs fails

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "ElevenLabs not configured" message
- Check that your `.env` file exists in `smash_ui/`
- Verify the API key is correct and has remaining character quota
- Restart the development server after adding environment variables

### Voice not playing
